## I think a multiple regression model would be best to use

# import the datset "recession_indicators.csv" from github

## Null = none of the variables has a relationship with causing a recession

## Alt = atleast one of the variables has a relationship with causing a recession

```{r cars}
options(scipen = 999)
Recession_regression <- glm(Recess ~ UnempRate + GSPC.Volume + GSPC.Close, data = recession_indicators)

summary(Recession_regression)
```

```{r}
1-pchisq(18.148 - 10.321, 215 - 212)
```

# P-VALUE = 0.04972573
# all of the data are statistically significant

# reject null hypothesis as all the data p-value are less than 5%



# higher unemployment rate = less likely for recession

# higher volume = more likely recession

#higher closing price = less likely recession
```{r}
# Get predicted probabilities
recession_indicators$pred_prob <- predict(Recession_regression, type = "response")

# Plot
plot(
  recession_indicators$pred_prob,
  recession_indicators$Recess,
  xlab = "Predicted Probability",
  ylab = "Actual Recession (0/1)",
  main = "Logistic Regression: Predicted Probability vs Actual"
)

# Add a trend line
abline(glm(Recess ~ pred_prob, data = recession_indicators), col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```

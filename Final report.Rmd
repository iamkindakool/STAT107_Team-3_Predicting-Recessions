##Abstract

  This project aims to explore, using the R programming language, whether recent US economic data can be used to predict impending economic recessions. We analyzed several financial indicators from the past five years, such as the unemployment rate and the S&P 500 performance. We examined how changes in these indicators correlated and whether they consistently signaled periods of economic weakness, thus helping us to predict future recessions and their end. This research will help us analyze charts and historical data and determine our hypotheses. Finally, we will build a model to predict the probability of a recession at some point in the future.

## Introduction

  This analysis will explore whether recent U.S. financial data can be used to warn of a potential economic recession. This analysis will help our users prepare for an impending economic downturn. We attempt to test a hypothesis to understand whether we can use data to predict trends and prepare for an upcoming recession.

  The main question we try to answer is can we predict the coming recession and its duration by using enough research and recent trends in a large amount of key U.S. economic data (such as the S&P 500 and unemployment rate)?

  This analysis will benefit economists, policymakers, investors, and finance and economics students interested in understanding the structure and future trajectory of the U.S. economy.

  The goal of this analysis is to test the following hypotheses and attempt to train a model that can predict recessions; based on our chosen data model, we believe recent U.S. economic data can be used to predict future economic trends. We will use the unemployment rate and S&P 500 to build a recession prediction model.

This project aims to provide evidence-based insights and answers to the health and trends of the future U.S. economy by using the analysis of historical data and the development of predictive models.

## Data 
Datasets and Sources:

s&P 500 stocks - Yahoo!
Economic Recession Dates - Federal Reserve
Unemployment Rate - Federal Reserve

Variables and Observations:

Date (Time Period)
GDP Growth Rate (%)
Unemployment Rate (%)
Federal Funds Rate (%)
Major Stock Index Closing Price $

Data process and objective:
  
  This analysis is based on US economic and financial data, including inflation, unemployment, and stock market performance (S&P 500 returns). For each variable, we used at least five years of observational data. All data are sourced from publicly available financial and economic databases, representing actual historical data rather than simulated values.

  To construct a single data set for the analysis, we downloaded and updated the data set by date. We removed missing values or obviously erroneous observations to maintain data source consistency. We converted all date fields to a common format and standardized the time frequency of each variable to monthly. Where necessary, we converted variables to percentage changes or ratios, such as the monthly returns of the S&P 500 and the monthly changes in the unemployment rate.

  The resulting data set is a clear and consistent panel of key economic variables, which will help refine the model in the rest of this analysis.

##Visualization

  We use histograms, pair graphs, and scatter plots to analyze and answer questions for our models and hypotheses, and to visualize the trends of economic recessions. First, we'll use two histograms to visualize our economic variables (unemployment rate and stock market performance – the S&P 500 return). This will help us see how these variables have trended and provide percentage answers as economic recessions have progressed. Next, we'll use a pair graph to compare the unemployment rate and the S&P 500 return. This will help us further analyze how the trends of these two variables correlate before the changes in the economic recession, providing more accurate answers for our hypotheses and models.

##Analysis

  To simulate the risk of economic recession, we fitted a logistic regression model in R, using recession status (recession vs. non-recession) as a binary response variable:

  Unemployment Rate: For the unemployment rate, we obtained an estimate of -8.136e-01, indicating a negative correlation between unemployment and recession. This means that a lower unemployment rate is more strongly associated with a recession. The p-value for this variable is also 0.002111, indicating its high significance in predicting recessions.

  Note: A high unemployment rate does not necessarily indicate a recession, possibly due to the lag in unemployment rate reporting and the fact that layoffs typically occur later in a recession.

  S&P 500 Trading Volume: For trading volume, we obtained an estimate of 1.096e-10, indicating a correlation between higher trading volume and recession. The p-value for this variable is 0.000155, which is very small, indicating its high significance in predicting recessions.

  S&P 500 Closing Price: For the closing price, our estimate is -2.750e-03, also showing a negative correlation. This means that lower closing prices are more strongly associated with recessions. The p-value for this variable is also very small at 0.002214, indicating its high significance in predicting recessions.

  Diagnostic plots (residuals vs. fitted values, normal Q-Q plot, scale-location plot, and residuals vs. leverage plot) do not show any serious violations of model assumptions, although a few months of extreme market volatility resulted in larger residuals, which could be considered potential outliers. However, these situations do not materially change the overall conclusions, and the fitted model remains stable.

  Using the model, we calculated the monthly predicted recession probability and compared it to historical recession dates in the U.S. national economic record. The predicted probability rose to 68% at the start of the Great Recession in January 2008 and fell to 24.5% near the end of the Great Recession in June 2009. Regarding the 2020 economic recession, the model predicted a 99.1% probability in March 2020, which dropped to almost 0% by June 2020. These results are in excellent agreement with our model. This model can provide an effective one-month early warning signal for a US economic recession.


##Conclusion
  The aim of this project is to investigate whether recent US economic and financial variables can be used to predict economic recessions. We constructed a logistic regression model using the unemployment rate, S&P 500 trading volume, and closing price as predictor variables. The results showed a significant statistical association between these variables and the risk of economic recession. The predicted probability of recession increased significantly during periods of rising unemployment, increased trading volume, and falling stock prices.

  Interestingly, even with limited and publicly available financial data, we can still observe warnings that are highly consistent with historical recessions, especially in scenarios where "rising unemployment and a weakening stock market overlap," where the probability of a recession given by the model increases significantly.

  However, this model is far from perfect. It is based on a limited number of variables and a relatively small sample of recession events. Furthermore, it does not account for structural changes, policy interventions, or unusual shocks. Therefore, future research could expand this analysis by incorporating more predictive factors and other financial variables, and by testing and adding more flexible models to achieve more accurate analysis, thereby capturing trend changes and early warnings.

## I think a multiple regression model would be best to use

import the datset "recession_indicators.csv" from github

Null = 0 (none of the variables has a relationship with causing a recession)

Alt != 0 (atleast one of the variables has a relationship with causing a recession)

```{r cars ,echo=FALSE}
recession_indicators <- read.csv("recession_indicators.csv")
options(scipen = 999)
Recession_regression <- glm(Recess ~ UnempRate + GSPC.Volume + GSPC.Close, data = recession_indicators)
```

 y = -0.2639548309702501 + -0.0394694141138171 * UnempRate + 0.0000000000098387 * Volume + -0.0000988752318664 * Close

# confidence interval

```{r }
confint(Recession_regression, level = 0.95)
```
# the CI is very narrow for all the variables



```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(Recession_regression)
summary(Recession_regression)
```

#calculating P-value of regression model

using chi-square to find p-value(null deviance - Residual deviance, dfNull - dfResidual)

```{r}
1-pchisq(18.148 - 10.321, 215 - 212)

```

# P-VALUE = 0.04972573
all of the data are statistically significant

reject null hypothesis as all the data p-value are less than 5%


higher unemployment rate = less likely for recession

higher volume = more likely recession

higher closing price = less likely recession

#Plotting
trying to figure out a useful plot for the regression model

Still working on it
```{r, echo= FALSE}
# Get predicted probabilities
recession_indicators$pred_prob <- predict(Recession_regression, type = "response")

# Plot
plot(
  recession_indicators$pred_prob,
  recession_indicators$Recess,
  xlab = "Predicted Probability",
  ylab = "Actual Recession (0/1)",
  main = "Logistic Regression: Predicted Probability vs Actual"
)

```
